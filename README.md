# Crossing the Aisle: an EDA on Senate Bipartisanship

An EDA regarding bipartisanship in the American federal Senate. Includes development of a metric for comparing strength of bipartisanship per vote and initial hypothesis testing utilizing American federal data.

## Rationale

Research indicates that American voters respond positively to suggestions that certain policy positions enjoy bipartisan support.  Research suggests that many less party-aligned voters will adjust their opinion of and willingness to support legislation if they are convinced that it has bipartisan support.

There is no standard definition of bipartisanship, and the legislative process is not well understood by many voters. 

It’s difficult to fact check and weigh the merits of a politician’s assertions. It’s also difficult for a politician to counter spurious suggestions of bipartisanship with any currently accepted metric.

## Developing a Metric

A metric that takes into account a range of bipartisanship (from purely partisan)
