# Crossing the Aisle: an EDA on Senate Bipartisanship

An EDA regarding bipartisanship in the American federal Senate. Includes development of a metric for comparing strength of bipartisanship per vote and initial hypothesis testing utilizing American federal data.

## Rationale

[Research suggests](https://www.dartmouth.edu/~seanjwestwood/papers/Westwood2020.pdf) that American voters respond positively policy positions that claim bipartisan support.  Furthermore, voters are likely adjust their opinion of and increase their willingness to support legislation if claims are framed in bipartisan terms.

There is no standard definition of bipartisanship, and the legislative process is not well understood by many voters. 

[As this politifact article suggests](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/feb/12/veronica-escobar/what-acceptable-measure-bipartisanship/), it’s difficult to fact check and weigh the merits of a politician’s assertions. It’s also difficult for a politician to counter spurious suggestions of bipartisanship with any currently accepted metric.

## Developing a Metric: the Bipartisanship Ratio (BPR)

A metric that takes into account a range of bipartisanship would greatly assist in analyzing the issue. 

The proposed metric, the Bipartisanship Ratio (BPR) would allow us to calculate the balance of the primary political parties for each individual roll-call vote in both chambers of Congress.
